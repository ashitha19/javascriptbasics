          <div id="main_content"><h4>Javascript Basics</h4>
                       <p> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a 
                variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to 
                take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment 
                (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide 
                programmatic control over them.</p>

            <ul>
              <li class="inner"><a href="">Variable Declaration:</a>JavaScript variables are containers for storing 
                  data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. 
                  All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.
                  <span class="change">var x;</span></li>
  
              <li class="inner"><a href="">Variable Assignment:</a>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript 
                variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment 
                operator assigns a value to a variable.<span class="change">var x = 10;</span></li>
</a></li>
  
              <li class="inner"><a href="">Data Type:</a>Data types are an important concept; to be able to 
                  operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: 
                  Boolean -<span class="change">true</span> or<span class="change">false;</span> null - <span class="change">null</span> aka nothing; Number -
                  <span class="change">42</span> or<span class="change">3.14159;</span> String -
                  <span class="change">“Coding Dojo Rocks!”;</span> 
                  Array - <span class="change">[1, ‘Coding’, 2, ‘Dojo’];</span> and<span class="change">Object - {first_name: ‘Jane’, last_name: ‘Doe’}
                  </span></li>
          
              <li class="inner"><a href="">Conditionals:</a>When you write code, you want to perform different 
                  actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have 
                  been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following 
                  condition statements:<span class="change">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block;
                  <span class="change">else if</span> to specify 
                  a new condition to test, if the condition is false;<span class="change">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
  
              <li class="inner"><a href="">Loops:</a>There are many different kinds of loops in every 
                  programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number 
                  of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track foursomes and then you stop. 
                  Thats a loop!</li>
  
              <li class="inner"><a href="">Function:</a>Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. 
                  When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an 
                  example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get 
                  started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next place the table the right way up. Done! We 
                  finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and 
                  over and over again.</li>
